        <h1 id="04_moviecareer">Movie Career</h1>
        <p>
            Although Mahesh made his debut as a lead actor in the year 1999 with the movie Raja Kumarudu, he first appeared in front of the camera two
             decades earlier, in 1979. At the age of four, Mahesh debuted as a child actor in the Telugu movie, Needa. Four years later, Mahesh appeared 
             in Poratam and impressed by his screen presence, director Kodi Ramakrishna decided to cast him in his next movie. Soon, Mahesh was cast in many 
             Telugu movies including Sankharavam, Mugguru Kodukulu, Bazaar Rowdy, Gudachari 117, and Koduku Diddina Kapuram. However, in the year 1990,
              Krishna insisted that Mahesh should take a break and rather concentrate on his studies.
            It was almost a decade later that Mahesh made his debut with the movie Raja Kumarudu - also starring Priety Zinta-
             and this marked the entry of a talented young star in the Telugu film industry. Soon after the success of the movie,
              Mahesh earned the title of `The Little Prince`. Mahesh even went on to grab the Nandi Award for Best Male Actor for
               his performance in the movie. However, Mahesh failed to carry forward the success of his debut movie to his next two releases
                - Yuvaraju and Vamsi, which were both commercial failures.
            Mahesh`s next release, Murari, was one of the most important releases of his career.
             The movie was a commercial hit and Mahesh terms this role as one of his favorites.
              His performance in the movie earned him a Nandi Special Jury Award. Following this, his next two releases weren`t well received at the 
              box office and he only found success with the 2003 release - Okkadu, the highest grossing Telugu movie of the year. Mahesh went on 
              to win his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the movie as well.
            
            Although his next movie, Nijam, was a commercial failure, Mahesh managed to earn favorable reviews from the critics and won his first Nandi Best Actor award.
            
            His sister, Manjula, produced his next movie, Naani, which turned out to be a disaster at the box office and the failure left both of them disappointed.
             However, Mahesh bounced back with a powerful performance in Athadu, released in 2005. Mahesh`s next two movies - Pokiri and Athidhi- once again impressed the audience, 
             however, he decided to take a break from movies post Athidhi. Initially planned for several months, his break extended to two years as the next movie he signed, Khaleja,
              was delayed. Further, Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and turned out to be a commercial failure.
            
            Post Khaleja, from 2011 to 2013, Mahesh delivered several hits including Dookudu, Businessman, and Seethamma Vakito Sirimalle Chettu. As fruitful as these years were for Mahesh, 
            2014 turned out to be disappointing as both his releases Nenokkadine and Aagadu failed to impress and failed at the box office.Soon, in 2015, Mahesh ventured into production and
             co-produced the film, Srimanthudu, under his newly formed production house, G. Mahesh Babu Entertainment Pvt. Ltd.
            
            Mahesh Babu was recently seen in the Telugu-Tamil bilingual movie, Bhahmotsavam, which was released in May 2016. The movie received a poor response at the box office.
           However, Mahesh`s performance was praised by the audience. His other projects include Spyder (2017), Bharat Ane Nenu (2018), Maharshi (2019) and Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020).
           His 2022 film Sarkaru Vaari Paata also received a mixed response, however, his performance was appreciated by critics. He also voiced the narrator in Ram Charan`s movie Acharya (2022)
           and produced Major (2022). He then featured in Guntur Kaaram (2024).
